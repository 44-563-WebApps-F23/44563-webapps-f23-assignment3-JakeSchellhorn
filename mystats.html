    <h1>Jake Schellhorn</h1>
    <p>I grew up in a small town of just 750 people here in Missouri. I played a lot of 
        sports in high school but also a lot of video games hints my love for technology. 
        While I was still in high school I joined the Army National Guard and am still 
        serving currently in college. I am working right now to go to Officer Candidate 
        School next summer to become a commissioned officer in the Guard.</p>
    <h3>Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
        My favorite food is always changing but lasagna is my favorite as of now. I pretty much love all things pasta
        and when you can add three different cheeses to it in large amounts you can count me in. I also love lasagna because 
        it is fun to make and the leftovers are almost always better than having the first time.
